# Section 2: The PDD Awakening

I'll be honest—I walked into that AWS event as a skeptic. Prompt-Driven Development felt like another buzzword in an industry already drowning in them. Sure, I'd experimented with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for quick coding tasks, but the idea that prompting could fundamentally reshape how we build software? That seemed like Silicon Valley hyperbole.

The session started with familiar territory: demonstrations of AI coding assistants, discussions about productivity gains, the usual metrics about lines of code generated per hour. But then something shifted. The presenter, drawing from Laura Tacho and Abi Noda's research on measuring AI adoption, made a point that stopped me cold: "AI-generated code is still code." 

It sounds obvious, but the implications hit like a revelation. All our existing practices around code review, testing, security scanning, performance monitoring—they don't become obsolete in an AI-augmented world. They become more critical. The AI doesn't replace our engineering discipline; it amplifies both our capabilities and our responsibilities.

As the discussion evolved, I realized my fundamental misunderstanding. I'd been thinking about PDD as a technical practice—a new way to write code faster. But the practitioners in that room were describing something far more profound: organizational transformation. They talked about prompt libraries as shared knowledge assets, about new collaboration patterns between developers and domain experts, about governance frameworks that needed to evolve to handle AI-generated content.

Sitting in that converted warehouse, surrounded by the preserved tiles of Manchester's industrial past, I understood that we weren't just witnessing another development trend. We were experiencing the kind of foundational shift that happens maybe once in a generation. The question wasn't whether PDD would reshape software development—it was whether we'd be ready when it did.
