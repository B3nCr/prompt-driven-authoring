# Section 4: The Metrics Challenge

One of the most practical questions that emerged from the Manchester discussions was deceptively simple: How do you measure success when AI becomes a core part of your development process?

Laura Tacho and Abi Noda's research provides a crucial foundation here. Their work on measuring AI adoption in development teams reinforces that traditional software metrics don't become obsoleteâ€”they remain foundational. Code quality, test coverage, deployment frequency, lead time, and mean time to recovery are still the bedrock measurements that indicate healthy development practices.

But AI-augmented development requires additional layers of measurement. You need visibility into prompt effectiveness, AI-generated code quality patterns, and the human review overhead that AI assistance introduces. Are your developers spending more time reviewing AI suggestions than they would have spent writing code from scratch? Are certain types of prompts consistently producing code that requires significant rework?

The key is starting with what you already know works, then thoughtfully adding AI-specific measurements. Track the percentage of code that's AI-generated versus human-written, but more importantly, track whether that AI-generated code passes your existing quality gates at the same rate as human-written code. Monitor prompt reuse patterns to identify opportunities for standardization and knowledge sharing.

Here's where many organizations fall into the vanity metrics trap. Lines of code generated per hour or percentage of AI-assisted commits might feel impressive in executive dashboards, but they don't tell you whether you're building better software faster. Focus on business outcomes: Are you delivering features more quickly? Are you reducing defect rates? Are you enabling teams to tackle more complex problems?

The most successful teams I've observed treat AI metrics as leading indicators of traditional software delivery metrics, not replacements for them. They use AI adoption data to predict and improve their core development performance, creating a feedback loop that makes both human and artificial intelligence more effective over time.
