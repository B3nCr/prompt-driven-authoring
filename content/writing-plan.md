# Writing Plan: Systematic Content Creation

## Overview
This writing plan breaks down the blog post creation into manageable, prompt-driven sections that can be executed systematically.

## Writing Session Structure
Each section includes:
- **Target word count**
- **Key elements to include**
- **Specific prompt for AI assistance**
- **Quality checkpoints**

---

## Section 1: Opening Hook (200-300 words)
**Objective**: Establish setting, introduce metaphor, hook the reader

### Key Elements:
- Manchester morning scene
- Hanover Building description
- Historical contrast (1907 → 2020)
- Stonemason's "Sidney" error detail
- Transition to main theme

### Writing Prompt:
```
Write an engaging opening for a blog post about Prompt-Driven Development. Set the scene on a rainy Manchester morning walking to the historic Hanover Building (originally a 1907 Co-operative Wholesale Society warehouse, now Amazon's first UK office outside London). Include the detail about a stonemason's error where "Sydney" was misspelled as "Sidney" on the building's medallions - use this as a metaphor for human imperfection vs AI precision. The tone should be reflective and professional, aimed at technology leaders. End with a transition that connects this historic transformation to the AI transformation happening in software development today.

## Section 2: The PDD Awakening (300-400 words)
**Objective**: Share the AWS event experience and key insights

### Key Elements:
- AWS event context
- Initial PDD skepticism → conversion
- "AI-generated code is still code" principle
- Organizational transformation realization

### Writing Prompt:
```
Continue the blog post by describing an AWS event at the Manchester building focused on AI tooling across the SDLC. Explain how this event shifted your perspective on Prompt-Driven Development from initial skepticism to understanding it as organizational transformation, not just a technical practice. Reference Laura Tacho and Abi Noda's principle that "AI-generated code is still code" and explain why traditional quality practices remain relevant. Keep the tone personal but professional, showing the journey from skeptic to advocate.
```

## Section 3: What PDD Really Means (400-500 words)
**Objective**: Define PDD comprehensively across three dimensions

### Key Elements:
- Technical dimension (prompt engineering, SDLC integration)
- Organizational dimension (teams, communication, skills)
- Governance dimension (security, compliance, risk)

### Writing Prompt:
```
Write a comprehensive section defining what Prompt-Driven Development really means beyond the buzzwords. Structure it around three dimensions: Technical (prompt engineering as core skill, SDLC integration, quality gates), Organizational (multi-disciplinary teams, new communication patterns, skill development), and Governance (security considerations, compliance, risk management). Make it practical and actionable for technology leaders who need to understand the full scope of PDD adoption. Use clear subheadings and bullet points where appropriate.
```

## Section 4: The Metrics Challenge (300-400 words)
**Objective**: Address measurement and success criteria

### Key Elements:
- Traditional metrics still relevant
- New AI-specific metrics needed
- Laura Tacho & Abi Noda framework reference
- Practical measurement approach
- Avoid vanity metrics warning

### Writing Prompt:
```
Write a section about measuring success in AI-augmented development. Explain that traditional software metrics remain foundational while new AI-specific measurements are needed. Reference Laura Tacho and Abi Noda's work on measuring AI adoption in development teams. Provide practical guidance on starting with known metrics and adding AI-specific layers. Include a warning about avoiding vanity metrics and focusing on business outcomes instead.
```

## Section 5: Implementation Wisdom (400-500 words)
**Objective**: Provide practical guidance for leaders

### Key Elements:
- Start small philosophy (prototypes, MVPs, spikes)
- Team preparation strategies
- Governance evolution approach

### Writing Prompt:
```
Create a practical implementation guide for technology leaders adopting PDD. Structure it around three key areas: 1) Start Small Philosophy - using prototypes, MVPs, and spikes for low-risk experimentation, 2) Team Preparation - skill development priorities and communication pattern changes, 3) Governance Evolution - adapting security, quality gates, and risk assessment for AI-augmented development. Make it actionable with specific recommendations they can implement immediately.
```

---

## Section 6: Looking Forward (200-300 words)
**Objective**: Paint the future vision and create urgency

### Key Elements:
- PDD becomes standard practice prediction
- Early adopter advantage
- Innovation vs governance balance
- Call to action for immediate start

### Writing Prompt:
```
Write a forward-looking section predicting that PDD will become standard practice within 2-3 years. Explain the competitive advantage for early adopters while acknowledging the challenge of balancing innovation with governance. Create a sense of urgency around starting PDD adoption now, but emphasize doing it thoughtfully. End with a clear call to action encouraging readers to begin their PDD journey with small experiments today.
```

---

## Section 7: Closing (100-150 words)
**Objective**: Return to opening metaphor, memorable ending

### Key Elements:
- Return to Hanover Building metaphor
- Historic preservation + modern innovation theme
- "We're all stonemasons now" concept
- Future being built in spaces that honor the past

### Writing Prompt:
```
Write a closing that returns to the Manchester Hanover Building metaphor. Connect the theme of historic preservation combined with modern innovation to how we should approach PDD adoption. Use the concept that "we're all stonemasons now, but with AI assistance" - building the future while learning from the past. End with a memorable thought about the future being built in spaces (both physical and conceptual) that honor what came before.
```

## Quality Checkpoints
After each section:
1. **Word count check** - within target range
2. **Message clarity** - key points clearly communicated
3. **Audience alignment** - appropriate for technology leaders
4. **Flow check** - smooth transition to next section
5. **Tone consistency** - reflective, professional, practical

## Final Assembly Process
1. Combine all sections in order
2. Review transitions between sections
3. Check overall word count (target: 1500-3000)
4. Verify key messages are reinforced throughout
5. Proofread for consistency and clarity
6. Add any necessary subheadings or formatting

## Publication Preparation
- Create compelling title from options in outline
- Add author bio and relevant links
- Format for target publication platform
- Schedule for early next week publication
