# PDD Methodology Evolution Research

## Research Objective
Investigate current limitations of PDD and emerging solutions for methodology improvement.

## Current Limitations (from Manchester Experience)
- **Hallucination Issues**: PDD doesn't solve AI hallucination problems
- **Code Generation Volume**: Can generate more code than humanly reviewable
- **Technical Issues**: 
  - Generated redundant infrastructure (CDK + Terraform)
  - Pulled in outdated dependencies
- **Scope Limitation**: Currently focused on engineering vs. full PDLC

## Areas for Evolution Research
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Emerging techniques and tools
- **Code Review Automation**: Tools for managing high-volume AI code generation
- **Dependency Management**: Solutions for keeping AI-generated dependencies current
- **Multi-disciplinary Integration**: Expanding PDD beyond engineering

## Research Questions
- What are the latest approaches to reducing AI hallucination in code generation?
- How are organizations managing code review for AI-generated content?
- What tools exist for automated dependency validation and updates?
- How is PDD methodology being adapted for broader organizational use?
- What are the success patterns for PDD implementation at scale?

## Future Vision Elements
- Technical improvements to PDD process
- Organizational adaptations and expansions
- Integration with governance frameworks
