# Background Context

## Setting
- AWS Manchester office in preserved old coop building
- Rainy Manchester morning
- Cool architecture with central atrium cafe featuring original tiles
- **Research note**: Investigate history of the building housing AWS Manchester office

## Event Details
- Mixed group: Accenture colleagues + public sector participants
- Focus on agentic AI and MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Demos included:
  - Local MCP server setup
  - Amazon Q introduction
  - MCP servers: Jira, AWS knowledge, AWS diagramming

## Funny Moment
- Colleague nearly lost laptop on way to work
- Found it using AirTag, retrieved via taxi
- Keep lighthearted in blog

## PDD Experience & Insights
- Added useful structure to projects
- Made good progress on individual projects
- Unclear if PDD improved quality or speed

## Key Concerns Identified
1. **Code Generation Volume**: Agentic coding can generate more code than humanly reviewable (especially in hackathon context)
2. **Hallucination Issues**: PDD didn't solve AI hallucination problems
3. **Technical Issues Encountered**:
   - Generated both CDK and Terraform (redundant)
   - Pulled in significantly outdated dependencies

## PDD Evolution & Adaptations Needed
- **Multi-disciplinary Integration**: PDD should expand beyond engineering to include other PDLC professions
- Engineers shouldn't bear sole responsibility for product strategy and market research
- **Orchestration Opportunities**: Different agents could coordinate PDD process using tools like JIRA MCP
- Enable right roles to input at appropriate times in the process

## Security & Governance Benefits
- **Explicit Instructions**: PDD provides opportunity to give clear security guidelines to agents
- **Policy Enforcement**: Can help prevent agents from violating company security policies
- **Examples of Security Instructions**:
  - "You must not install dependencies from public registries"
  - "You must not execute using sudo"
- Proactive approach to preventing prohibited actions vs. reactive monitoring

## Audience Context
- Technology leaders adopting AI across Software/Product Development Life Cycle
- Cross-sector perspective (private + public sector)
